**A guardrail can react to a bad request in two ways: say *no* (hard block — the task fails) or say *here's how* (steering — the agent fixes the request and finishes). This demo contrasts a blocking lifecycle hook with native Strands steering, using one real rule: a room holds at most 10 guests. Ask to book 15 and watch each approach.**

## The Problem

A hard guardrail stops the harm but strands the user. If the rule is "max 10 guests per room" and someone asks to book 15, a blocking hook simply cancels the tool call. The agent is told *rejected* with no path forward — the booking never happens, and the only "recovery" is the model guessing a fix on its own, unguided.

Demo 04 showed hooks that **block**. The gap: blocking is the right move for a hard safety stop, but for a *recoverable* violation it throws away a completable task.

## The Solution

Native Strands **steering** reads the real tool input before the call runs and, instead of cancelling, returns a `Guide` that tells the agent *how* to comply. The agent self-corrects and completes the task.

```python
from strands.vended_plugins.steering import SteeringHandler, Guide, Proceed, ToolSteeringAction

MAX_PER_ROOM = 10

class MaxGuestsSteering(SteeringHandler):
    name = "max-guests"
    async def steer_before_tool(self, *, agent, tool_use, **kwargs) -> ToolSteeringAction:
        if tool_use.get("name") != "book_hotel":
            return Proceed()
        guests = (tool_use.get("input") or {}).get("guests", 1)
        if guests and guests > MAX_PER_ROOM:
            rooms = split(guests)                 # 15 -> [10, 5], 23 -> [10, 10, 3]
            return Guide(reason=f"...split into {len(rooms)} rooms of {rooms} and book each.")
        return Proceed()
```

Key points, and what the old version got wrong:

| Old (broken) | This demo |
|---|---|
| Required an external **Agent Control server** + `agent-control-sdk` | **Native Strands steering** — no server, nothing to run |
| Prompt forced the LLM to **narrate** the guest count so a **regex** could catch it | Reads the **real structured tool input** `tool_use["input"]["guests"]` |
| Split **hardcoded** to 10 + 5 | **Generic** `ceil(guests / 10)`: 15 → [10, 5], 23 → [10, 10, 3] |
| Deny-no-payment control that never checked payment | Removed; the rule here is a real, verifiable limit |

### Rules can live outside the code (optional)

The same handler can load its limit from an external source (`rules.json`, a config service) instead of a constant — so business rules live outside code **without** needing an Agent Control server. If you *do* use Agent Control, it is strictly optional: this demo runs fully without it.

```python
rules = json.load(open("rules.json"))     # {"max_guests_per_room": 10}
RuleSteering(rules)                         # same native steering, cap from config
```

## Architecture

- **Steering** (`MaxGuestsSteering`) — a `SteeringHandler` plugin that guides `book_hotel` to split oversize parties. Reads structured tool input; no regex, no server.
- **Blocking hook** (`BlockOversizeRoomHook`) — a `BeforeToolCallEvent` hook that `cancel_tool`s the oversize call, shown only as the contrast.
- **Booking store** (`BookingStore`) — reservations go to a local JSON file through an `@tool` class method (`book_hotel` has a `guests` parameter so steering can read it). Swappable to Amazon DynamoDB by reimplementing `_load`/`_save`; the agent code is unchanged. Bookings never live in `agent.state`.
- **Neo4j** (`HotelCheck.hotel_exists`) — **read-only**: confirms a hotel exists before booking. Neo4j never writes.
- **Model** — Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4) by default.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test_hooks_vs_control.ipynb` | The walkthrough: Part 1 blocking hook, Part 2 native steering, Part 3 rule-from-config |
| `steering_tools.py` | `MaxGuestsSteering`, `RuleSteering`, `BlockOversizeRoomHook`, read-only `HotelCheck` |
| `booking_store.py` | JSON booking store (swappable to DynamoDB) |
| `rules.json` | External rule source for `RuleSteering` |
| `chat.py` | Small REPL to try steering yourself |
| `.env.example` | Neo4j + region config (no secrets) |

## Run It

```bash
cd 05-steering-demo
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # set NEO4J_PASSWORD

# Notebook
AWS_PROFILE=<profile> AWS_REGION=us-east-1 jupyter notebook test_hooks_vs_control.ipynb

# Or the REPL
AWS_PROFILE=<profile> AWS_REGION=us-east-1 python chat.py
```

Prerequisite: a running Neo4j with the demo-01 hotel graph (see [`01-graphrag-demo`](../01-graphrag-demo/)).

### What you'll see

```
[STEERING] 🧭 15 > 10/room → split into [10, 5]
...
✅ 2 rooms booked:
  BK0001: 10 guests at Cliffside Resort
  BK0002: 5 guests at Cliffside Resort
total guests: 15
```

The agent asked to book all 15 in one room, steering guided it to split, and the booking **completed** — instead of failing.

## When to Block vs Steer

- **Block** when the action must not happen at all (unauthorized payment, policy-prohibited operation). A hard stop is correct.
- **Steer** when the request is *recoverable* — the intent is fine, only the shape is wrong (too many guests for one room). Guide the agent to the compliant version and let it finish.

## What's Next

These five defenses run locally. In **[Demo 06 — Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](../06-agentcore-boto3-demo/)** you take the same patterns to production with AgentCore Runtime, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB.
